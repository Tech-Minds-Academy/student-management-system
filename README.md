```
   Database -> models -> controllers -> views

   Views (fetch/post) -> controllers (Do some checks and work ) -> models (SQL queries) -> Database.
```

### Key Points:
- **Separation of concerns**: Logic (`controllers/`), database interactions (`models/`), and UI (`views/`) are neatly separated.
- **`config/` folder**: Centralized database and app settings.
- **`routes/web.php`**: Handles routing without needing a full MVC framework.
- **`includes/` folder**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **`public/`**: Main entry point for the app, can be configured in Apache/Nginx.


### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tech-minds-academy/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
